# Contributing to Xanadu

Thank you for your interest in Xanadu! We _gladly_ accept issues and PRs.

## Submitting an Issue

If a feature is missing or you believe you've found a bug, submitting an issue
is the best way to notify us (the contributors). You are also welcome to suggest
game enhancements through issues.

Here are some guidelines:

- Give your issue a descriptive but brief title
- Give your issue a descriptive (and long) explanation
- Identify what is wrong (bug/missing feature/enhancement)
  - What problem occurred?
  - What behavior did you expect?
  - Any steps to reproduce? (Pictures/videos/GIFs may also be helpful)
- If you are suggesting a new feature or enhancement, please explain how the
feature would improve the game
- [LOZORD](https://github.com/LOZORD) has
[the final say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life).
Fork it if you don't like it :sunglasses:

## Submitting a Pull Request

If you are submitting a PR, please be sure to reference the issue to which it
is related. If there is no existing issue, please create one.

Here are some guidelines:

- Touch a minimal number of files when making a PR
- All code should be written in TypeScript (__NOT__ in any form of JavaScript)
- All code should be as thoroughly typed as possible
- All edits should be tested (and therefore covered)
- All code should be linted and compilable with no issues
- Please use indents of __2 spaces__ and `LF` line endings
- Favor code readability over brevity
- Favor a functional, testable style over ... worse styles
